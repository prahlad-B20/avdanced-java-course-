In Java, exceptions are events that disrupt the normal flow of a program. They are categorized into two main types: checked and unchecked exceptions.
Checked Exceptions:
These are exceptions that the compiler forces you to handle. You must either:
Catch them: Surround the code that might throw the exception with a try-catch block.
Declare them: Add a throws clause to the method signature, indicating that the method might throw this exception.
Checked exceptions typically represent recoverable situations that can occur during the normal operation of a program, such as:
IOException: Occurs when there's an issue with input/output operations (e.g., reading from a file that doesn't exist).
SQLException: Occurs when there's an issue with database operations.
ClassNotFoundException: Occurs when the JVM can't find a required class.
Unchecked Exceptions:
These are exceptions that the compiler doesn't force you to handle. They typically represent programming errors or situations that are difficult to recover from.
Unchecked exceptions are subclasses of RuntimeException. Examples include:
NullPointerException: Occurs when you try to access a member of a null object.
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Occurs when you try to access an array element with an invalid index.
IllegalArgumentException: Occurs when a method is passed an invalid argument.
